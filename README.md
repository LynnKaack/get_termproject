# Replication files for: Making new from old? - Assessing regulatory novelty in EU renewable energy policies

The scripts for the data preparation, the text analysis and the comparison of the two Renewable Energy Directives are stored in the corresponding folder. The same applies to the graphics and other visualisations. 

The data, which was compiled as part of an SNF Spark Project (see [here](https://epg.ethz.ch/news-and-events/EPGNews/2019/11/epg-researchers-acquire-snf-spark-grant.html)), must be requested directly from the Energy Politics Group at ETH Zurich. The contact details can be found [here](https://epg.ethz.ch). 

The paper itself is available [here](https://www.polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/m9FdRzDI54boZFp).
